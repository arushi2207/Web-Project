# Web-Project
# Website Bookmarker

This project is a web application that allows users to bookmark their favorite websites using JavaScript CRUD operations.

## Description

This code sets up the basic structure of a web page for a bookmark system, with form inputs for adding bookmarks, a search feature, and a table for displaying bookmarks. The styling is enhanced with Bootstrap and a custom "style.css" file, and interactivity is provided by the "script.js" JavaScript file which provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing bookmarks.
